## 🏛 The Design Philosophy: "Authority Through Restraint"

Unlike standard portfolios, this platform is engineered as an **Institutional Asset**. The design system prioritizes typographic gravity and structural clarity over decorative elements.

- **Monochromic Precision:** A sophisticated `Ivory (#F9F9F8)` and `Obsidian (#0A0A0A)` palette.
- **Typographic Scale:** Utilizing massive serif headings to signal institutional history and bold sans-serifs for technical data.
- **Performance-First Motion:** Hardware-accelerated transitions using custom cubic-bezier curves (`[0.16, 1, 0.3, 1]`) for a fluid, lag-free experience.

## 🛠 Strategic Tech Stack

- **Core Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling Engine:** Tailwind CSS 4.0
- **Animation Orchestration:** Framer Motion (Optimized for 60FPS)
- **Typeface Selection:** Playfair Display (Serif) & Inter (Sans)
- **Icons:** Lucide React (Minimalist Set)
